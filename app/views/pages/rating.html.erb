<h1> Climbing Rating System</h1><br>
<div class="container">
    <div class="ydrs"><h2> Yosemite Decimal Rating System</h2>
    <h4><br>The YDRS breaks climbing down into classes and grades. 
    Nearly every climbing guide uses this system.</h4>
    <span>
        Class 1: Walking, on an established trail.<br>
        Class 2: Hiking, up a steep incline, possibly using your hands for balance.<br>
        Class 3: Climbing up a steep hillside; a rope is not normally used.<br>
        Class 4: Exposed climbing, following a ledge system for example. A rope would be used to belay past places where a fall could be lethal.<br>
        Class 5: This is where technical rock climbing begins. A rope and protection are needed to safeguard a fall by the person leading. Any unprotected fall from a class 5 climb would be harmful if not fatal. Class 5 climbs are subdivided into categories to give more detail.<br>

        5.0-5.4: Climbing up a ramp or a steep section with good holds.<br>
        5.5-5.7: Steeper, more vertical climbing, but still on good holds. These routes are also easily protected.<br>
        5.8 +/- Vertical climbing on small holds. A + means that the climbing is more sustained like a 5.9, but the route would still be considered a 5.8. If you see a – after the 5.8 rating it means that the climb only has one or two moves like a solid 5.8 would have, but more resembles a 5.7. <br>
        5.9 +/- This rating means that the climb might be slightly overhung or may have fairly sustained climbing on smaller holds. With practice the beginning climber can climb in the 5.9 range quickly and with confidence.<br>
        5.10 a, b, c, d Very sustained climbing. A weekend climber rarely feels comfortable in this range unless they do go EVERY weekend or has some natural talent. The difference between a 5.10 b and a 5.10 c is very noticeable. Most likely the climbs are overhung with small holds and are sustained or require sequential moves.<br>
        5.11 a, b, c, d This is the world of the dedicated climber. Expect steep and difficult routes that demand technical climbing and powerful moves.<br>
        5.12 a, b, c, d The routes in this range are usually overhanging climbs requiring delicate foot work on thin holds or long routes requiring great balance on little holds.<br>
        5.13 a, b, c, d If you can climb upside down on a glass window, these climbs are right up your alley.<br>
        5.14 a, b, c, d These climbs are among the hardest in the world.<br>
        5.15 a This is as hard as climbing gets, folks. Keep in mind that very few climbers can actually climb at this level.<br>

    <h4><br>Bouldering grading system.</h4>
    <span>
        Beginner: V0-V2
        You’ve either just started bouldering or have been at it for a few months. You’re still learning the basics and making quick progress. <br>
        Intermediate: V3-V5
        You’ve been bouldering for little while now and are starting to grow stronger as a result. You can now flash problems you couldn’t climb when you first entered the gym.<br>
        Advanced: V6-V8
        You’ve most likely been bouldering for a few years at least. The rapid rate of progression you had early on has likely slowed.<br>
        Expert: V9-V12
        You have been bouldering and training HARD for many years. You’re probably one of the top boulderers at your local gym. Weekends are spent bouldering outside. You can campus problems that intermediate boulderers are projecting and it makes them super frustrated, but you get a kick out of it.<br>
        Elite: ≥V13
        Bouldering is one of the top priorities in your life at the moment. You are probably sponsored and in incredibly good shape. People film you bouldering stuff.<br>
